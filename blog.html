        Dear Diary,<br>Yesterday saw the birth of this site. And I'm so excited to be working on this project. And I know that prbably no one will see this, but I've always wanted a space to call my own.<br>
        So here is my entry into yesteryear of Web 1.0. To think, very little knowledge is actually needed to build this site. It astounds me that I could have made this over a decade ago.<br>
        But here we are. New Year's 2023. My resolution for the next 12 months is to keep with this blog, however sporadic that may be.<br>See you in the New Year,<br>Artair Frostburn
