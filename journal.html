                Dear Diary,<br>So it's been the first week of the New Year. It has been an interesting week I suppose. I've truely delved into Final Fantasy XIV lore and I find myself falling in love with the world. 
                Something I never thought would happen.  You know I'm antisocial right? Well they implimented a system that allows you to run the main story with NPCs, thereby making the main story solo friendly. 
                I have also decided to change my character from a Miqo'te to an Au Ra. Which leads me on to the second major thing that happened this week. I learned about Kobolds from D&D. The lore surrounding them is just so awesome.
                I find them so fascinating and fitting that I changed my fursona to a Kobold. It fits into my reverance of Dragons and wanting to provide for my little community. Well, We'll see where the aether currents take us next.<br>

                Dear Diary,<br>Yesterday saw the birth of this site. And I'm so excited to be working on this project. And I know that probably no one will see this, but I've always wanted a space to call my own. 
                So here is my entry into yesteryear of Web 1.0. To think, very little knowledge is actually needed to build this site. It astounds me that I could have made this over a decade ago. 
                But here we are. New Year's 2023. My resolution for the next 12 months is to keep with this blog, however sporadic that may be.<br>See you in the New Year,<br>Artair Frostburn
