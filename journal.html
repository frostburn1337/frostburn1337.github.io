                Dear Diary,<br>Two months have past since the last entry. So much has changed. I finally bought a new laptop, a 12th gen Intel Framework 13. A fully right-to-repair modular laptop.<br>
                It has 4 Thunderbolt ports, which are inset to be expansion bays. So that you can have any configuration of ports that you desire. On another note, I'm also looking into astronomy.<br>
                Space is always something that has fascinated me. Oh Oh. I also got my liquor serving license. I'm also looking into bartending. I'm back on the night shift, which is perfect for me.<br>
                Always the night owl, you know. Welp. There's so much going on, I'm sure I'll be back soon to tell it all.<br>Until then,<br>Artair Frostburn signing off.

                Dear Diary,<br>Sorry it's been so long since the last entry. I've been deep in research the past couple of weeks. This time it's the Apple ecosystem.<br>
                I got my Lenovo Thinkpad T430 set up as a Hackintosh running macOS 12 Monterey. I've got the iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch. So I figured "Why not? Let's see what macOS has to offer."<br>
                So far, I'm actually liking it. I'm actually being more productive than before and this is with underpowered hardware. Image what I could accomplish if I had "Real" hardware.<br>
                I find myself actually wanting to work on the website now. And I'm giving a serious think about learning more web engineering skills so I could possibly freelance.
                But yeah, here we are.<br>Here's to learning new things,<br>Artair Frostburn

                Dear Diary,<br>So it's been the first week of the New Year. It has been an interesting week I suppose. I've truly delved into Final Fantasy XIV lore and I find myself falling<br>
                in love with the world. Something I never thought would happen.  You know I'm antisocial right? Well they implemented a system that allows you to run the main story with NPCs,<br>
                thereby making the main story solo friendly. I have also decided to change my character from a Miqo'te to an Au Ra. Which leads me on to the second major thing that happened this week.<br>
                I learned about Kobolds from D&D. The lore surrounding them is just so awesome. I find them so fascinating and fitting that I changed my fursona to a Kobold. It fits into my reverence<br>
                of Dragons and wanting to provide for my little community. Well, We'll see where the aether currents take us next.<br>Till Sea Swallows All,<br>Artair Frostburn

                Dear Diary,<br>Yesterday saw the birth of this site. And I'm so excited to be working on this project. And I know that probably no one will see this, but I've always wanted a space to<br>
                call my own. So here is my entry into yesteryear of Web 1.0. To think, very little knowledge is actually needed to build this site. It astounds me that I could have made this over a<br>
                decade ago. But here we are. New Year's 2023. My resolution for the next 12 months is to keep with this blog, however sporadic that may be.<br>See you in the New Year,<br>Artair Frostburn
